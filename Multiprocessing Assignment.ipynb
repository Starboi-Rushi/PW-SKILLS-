    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to run multiple processes (separate instances of a program) concurrently. Each process runs in its own memory space and has its own Python interpreter, allowing multiple tasks to be executed in parallel. Python provides the multiprocessing module to facilitate multiprocessing and parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about multiprocessing in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Multiprocessing is used to achieve parallelism, which is the execution of multiple tasks simultaneously. It is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks, where the program spends a significant amount of time performing computations or tasks that don't involve waiting for external resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): In the standard CPython interpreter (which is the most widely used Python interpreter), there is a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python code simultaneously. This means that in a multi-threaded Python program, only one thread can execute Python code at a time. Multiprocessing allows you to bypass the GIL by creating separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizes Multiple CPU Cores: When you have a multi-core CPU, multiprocessing enables you to utilize all available CPU cores efficiently. Each process can run on a different core, maximizing CPU usage and speeding up computation-intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: Processes in multiprocessing are independent of each other. They do not share memory by default, which can make it easier to reason about and control concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication Between Processes: Multiprocessing provides mechanisms for communication and synchronization between processes. For example, you can use Queue objects or Pipe objects to exchange data between processes. You can also use tools like Locks and Semaphores to control access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of Use: The multiprocessing module in Python provides a high-level, easy-to-use API for creating and managing processes, making it relatively simple to parallelize tasks."
