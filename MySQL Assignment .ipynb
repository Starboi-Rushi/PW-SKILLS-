    "NoSQL databases:\n",

    "Do not follow a rigid schema but instead have more flexible structures to accommodate their data types.\n",
    "Are horizontally scalable, meaning that more servers can be added to increase their data load.\n",
    "Are better for unstructured and semi-structured data like documents or JSON.\n",

    "3. **GROUP BY**: If you are using the `GROUP BY` clause, it is evaluated after the `WHERE` clause. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the selected rows into sets based on one or more columns. Aggregation functions, such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc., are often used in conjunction with `GROUP BY` to summarize data within each group.\n",

    "7. **LIMIT/OFFSET**: The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses, if used, restrict the number of rows returned by the query and control pagination. These clauses are typically applied after the `ORDER BY` clause.\n",

    "8. **UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT**: If your query involves set operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `EXCEPT`, these operations are applied after the previous clauses and combine the results of multiple queries.\n",
